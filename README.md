# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Melanie

I'm transitioning from Supply Chain Operations Manager to IT Support Engineer, with the long-term goal of becoming a Linux Systems Administrator. This GitHub is where I’m documenting the journey from zero to hero by being hands-on, transparent, and relentlessly curious.

Although my first love was art, technology has always been the quiet obsession feeding the left side of my brain. I learned by doing (and breaking things). That meant BIOS configs, fresh installs of Windows 7, and eventually a middle school side hustle: jailbreaking iPods and iPhones. Later in life, I built WordPress sites while self-teaching Python and front-end development. Every phase of my life has involved creating, deconstructing, and optimizing.

Now, I’m focused on building real-world technical skills through structured labs and repeatable workflows, and using this GitHub to prove it.

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

Coming from a background in supply chain and customer service, I bring:

- Documentation and SOP discipline
- Cross-functional coordination
- Workflow automation (to reduce human error and increase efficiency)
- Analytical thinking (demand forecasting, data interpretation)
- Resilience, resourcefulness, and a bias for execution

These skills transfer. Now I’m backing them with technical depth.

## 🎯 Current Goal:  
Land an IT Support or Help Desk role by Q1 2026. My technical roadmap includes:

- ✅ Google IT Support Certificate *(in progress)*
- 🎯 CompTIA Network+ *(certification target: [insert date])*
- ☁️ AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals)
- 📘 ITILv4 Foundations
- 🔁 PowerShell scripting, Active Directory, networking, MDM, and more
